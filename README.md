# osu-wal
Simple use of wal generated colorschemes to modify osu skins

This only works on linux so far, since it requires the use of wal/pywal.
This code is also hardcoded, not optimized for most people, that being said, it can be modified to fit your usecase as it does to me.

As for dependencies, 
you need wal to create the color scheme, the colors are usually saved in ~/.cache/wal/colors
you also need imagemagick.
